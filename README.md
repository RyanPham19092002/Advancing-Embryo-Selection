# Advancing Embryo Selection: A Comparative Study of State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Models for IVF Embryo Quality Assessment

This is the source code for the paper "Advancing Embryo Selection: A Comparative Study of State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Models for IVF Embryo Quality Assessment".
In this project, we implemented 4 models ResNet50, VGG19, EfficientNetB0 and MobileNet on the Embryo dataset based on microscopic images.
